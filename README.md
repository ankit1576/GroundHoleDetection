![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/063e7fc8-d7ca-493e-96d5-c0b396339a5d)

## Description
Ground Hole Detection is an automated object detection system designed to identify and monitor ground holes in border regions. Using the YOLOv8 model for real-time detection and localization with confidence score in a bounding boxes, it aims to enhance surveillance and safety in critical areas. This project integrates advanced computer vision techniques to provide accurate results while ensuring ease of use.

## Installation
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ankit1576/GroundHoleDetection.git
   cd GroundHoleDetection
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
